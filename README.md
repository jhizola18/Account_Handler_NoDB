# Account_Handler_NoDB
This is a simple Account Hanlder with no database
I used file handling to save the data and Vector when deleting a certain line of text

When updating a text the first you have to do is input the name of .txt file and then the info
you will put to change the current info and then indicate the specific line
NOTE  that when counting the lines start with 1 not 0 and count also the spaces
